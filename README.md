### An Exploration Into... 
# Screen Space Ambient Occlusion
Carried out as part of my MSc in Games Software Development.

In this repository you'll find a 'mini-research' project I carried out into implementing and analysing the performance of SSAO for games.
I may include the paper that acompanies this project in the future.

### Libraries used:
- [Assimp (Open Asset Import Library)](http://www.assimp.org/)
For ease of demoing this application, release configuration binaries of Assimp 'should' be included in this repo.
- [ ] Todo: remove these and build from source code.
